I just started the week 2 E-Portfolio and I had a question.
You added flex: 1 to a div so that the about me section takes the entire height.
I didn't understand how adding another class and giving it a display: flex also makes its 
children take the entire height as well. 

Could you explain the BEM, I find that a little confusing. Should we try to match the 
parent container? Like the block? 
For the modifier after there's double underscore and then there's two dash, and 
then if has another class, then there's one dash. Could you please explain this. 

How to understand when to use the double dash, as in which is the modifier and which is the 
element cause we are modifying both classes.

What is the difference between 
height: 100vh and min-height: 100vh

give parent:
min-height: 100vh;
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;

Now make children:
flex: 1, so it will take remaining entire height.
Now if want to give children also remaining height then add another class to this same class and
add
display: flex
so now it's children will also have the remaining height of the page.

Now let's say added another element below and want that only to have whole height.
So, can add
display: flex;
flex-direction: column

this we add to the children who also had remaining height

and now can add:
flex: 1;
to the newly added children to give it the entire height.
